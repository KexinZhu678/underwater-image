# Dataset
Complex lighted underwater image dataset (CLUID) can be downloaded at:  https://drive.google.com/drive/search?dmr=1&ec=wgc-drive-globalnav-goto&q=CLUID.    

# PISPD
1. The code for complex lighted underwater image enhancement has been publicly available.
2. The code has been tested on Windows 11 64bit with MATLAB 2021a.

# Usage
1. Place the image to be tested into the 'test' folder.
2. Please run the 'main.m' file and view the corresponding result in the 'result' folder.
